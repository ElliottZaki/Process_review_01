# Project title: SchoolReport - External Process review 01
# Motivation: 
This is my first external process review. For this exercise, I was assessed primarily on the process of how i attempt to create a programme. Abilities around Agile skills, TDD, information gathering, planning and communication were observed. A typical individual is assessed over a period of 30x minutes before recieving feedback.
# Opening statement:
The client works for a company that produces school reports.

Main goal:
Help teacher find out how their students are performing on tests.
- This programme is geared more towards teachers.\n

From the teachers, we are given a string, comma seperated values containing test results.

We would like to create a simple report that bring up the students grades.

Example Scores:
"Green, Green, Red, Amber, Red"
"Green: 2\n
Amber: 1\n
Red: 2"\n

If students dont get a certain colour, ie they just scored Green the output would look like this:
"Green: 1"
# Draft plan:
Create a basic scoring system that adds up the 3 possible variables from a string, Green, Amber & Red.

If there is an empty string = return "no results given".
# Build status:
Completed - Passing tests.
Completed - Exercise.
Pending - Refactor.
