# Project title: School_Report - External Process review 01
# Motivation: 
This is my first external process review. For this exercise, I was assessed primarily on the process of how i attempt to build a programme. I was assessed on my Agile skills, TDD, information gathering, planning and communication. You are assessed over a period of 30x minutes before recieving feedback.
# Opening statement:
The client works for a company that completes school reports.\n

Main goal:\n
Help teacher find out how their students are performing on tests.\n
- This programme is geared more towards teachers.\n

From the teachers, we are given a string, comma seperated values containing test results.\n

We would like to create a simple report that bring up the students grades.\n

Example Scores:\n
"Green, Green, Red, Amber, Red"\n
"Green: 2\n
Amber: 1\n
Red: 2"\n

If students dont get a certain colour, ie they just scored Green the output would look like this:\n
"Green: 1"\n
# Draft plan:
Create a basic scoring system that adds up the 3 possible variables, Green, Amber & Red.\n

If there is an empty string = return "no results given".\n
# Build status:
Completed - Passing tests.\n
Completed - Exercise.\n
Pending - Refactor.\n
